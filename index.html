            <h2>.ORIGAMI_RABBIT.</h2>
            <p><h2>You will need one sheet of square paper for this origami rabbit. Use origami paper or use the thinnest paper you have, using at least 15 x 15 cm paper to start with.


                
               <br> What You'll Need
                Materials
                <br>1 sheet 15x15-centimeter paper
                <br>Instructions
               <br> Begin Folds
                Start with your paper white side up or the color that you don't want to see, in this case, the bunny will be yellow.
                
                <br>Fold the top corner down to the bottom and make a precise crease.
                Fold both the top left and top right corners down to the bottom point and crease well.
                Fold the left and right corners up to the top point, again creasing well.
                Start with the right flap, open it out to the right, pressing the top of it down to form a slanted triangle. Repeat on the left side.

               <br> Make the Ears and Nose
                Rotate the paper to the left a little. Fold the top section backward and behind.
                Take the flap, which is at the bottom right, and flip it up and behind. This is a rotation movement, not a reverse fold. Repeat on the flap on the back.
                Fold the ears over to the left as indicated, the ears don't have to all be the same, as it's an animal, it looks nicer with some asymmetrical folds.
                Hold onto the ears at the head. Open out the left sections. The nose should go downward, while the left flaps are pushed over the top of the ears on both the front and back of the rabbit.

                <br>Finish up
                Make the two folds indicted and pleat fold them; the fold on the left is a mountain fold, while the diagonal fold is a valley fold. Open out the back of the rabbit to pleat fold them inside.
                Fold the nose under. This is now complete, but we like to fold the ears back out a little. We also like to glue the flaps that stick out from the neck, depending on what type of paper you use.

                   <br> origami Christmas tree
                   <br>KARA WHITTEN
                   <br> These folded paper tree creations make for the perfect Christmas Decorations. This idea comes from our contributor Kara Whitten. There are two ways to make a tannenbaum: one with straight edges for a modern look and one with an upturned edge to mimic real branches.
                    
                   <br> What you need
                   <br>Materials

                   <br> How to do it
                   <br>Part 1
                   <br>large origami trees
                   <br>STEP 1
                   <br>Cut paper into squares. For large trees, you will need one 4-by-4-foot square, one 3-by-3-foot square, and one 2-by-2-foot square. For all other smaller trees, one square (of any size) will yield one tree.
                    
                   <br>large origami trees
                   <br>STEP 2
                   <br> Fold paper square corner to corner, producing a triangle. Next, fold that triangle in half to create a smaller triangle. Open the paper back up and fold in half to create a rectangle and then fold the rectangle in half to create a square. Unfold to reveal the crease lines.

                   <br> STEP 3
                   <br> Next, tuck the two sides towards the center line to create a diamond shape.

                   <br>STEP 4
                   <br>Fold in the left and right side flaps to the center line on both sides to form a kite shape. 
                    
                   <br>large origami trees
                   <br>STEP 5
                   <br>Taking one side at a time, open the fold and fold the edge inward towards the center of the kite. Repeat with all four flaps.

                   <br>STEP 6
                   <br> Use your scissors to cut off the bottom triangle of the kite shape as shown. Make sure that you are cutting off the open tip and not the folded tip.

                   <br> STEP 7
                   <br> At this point you can spread out the flaps slightly to create your straight-edged tree. For the folded edge tree, continue on to step 8.

                   <br> STEP 8
                   <br> Using scissors, cut horizontal lines into each of the 6 flaps. (The size of the lines will vary depending on the size of tree you are making, but we recommend to cut approximately half-way in towards the center of each flap.)

                   <br>STEP 9
                   <br>Fold the cut lines down to create small triangles; repeat around all 6 sides of the tree.

                   <br>STEP 10
                   <br>For large paper trees, once all three squares have been folded into trees, simply stack them one on top of the next (starting with the largest tree on the bottom) to create a tall origami paper tree. </h2></p>
